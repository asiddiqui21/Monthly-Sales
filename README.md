# Monthly Sales Analysis and Visualization

Created a data analysis and visualization project to provide insights into sales data for a retail company. Leveraged Python and various libraries, such as pandas and matplotlib, to perform data analysis, clean and preprocess the data, and generate visualizations. The project aimed to identify sales trends, explore key metrics, and present actionable insights to support decision-making and business growth.

## Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Obtained the sales data from the company's database or CSV files and imported it into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data integrity.
- Derived new columns, such as calculating the total sales by multiplying the quantity and price, to enrich the dataset with relevant metrics.
- Explored the dataset by generating descriptive statistics, examining data distributions, and identifying outliers or anomalies.
- Conducted in-depth analysis of sales trends over time by grouping the data by month and year and calculating the total sales for each period.
- Created interactive visualizations, such as line plots or bar charts, using the matplotlib library to showcase monthly sales trends and highlight significant insights.
- Enhanced the visualizations by adding labels, titles, and gridlines to improve readability and clarity.
- Generated summary reports or dashboards summarizing the key findings and insights from the analysis.
- Communicated the results effectively to stakeholders, including presenting the visualizations and explaining the trends, patterns, and actionable recommendations.
- Received positive feedback from stakeholders for the clear and insightful analysis provided, enabling informed decision-making.
- Saved results in csv file.
